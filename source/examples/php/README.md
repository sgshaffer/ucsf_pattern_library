To run this Twig example you need to have Twig set up.

The current code example assumes composer will be used.

However, there are various ways to set up twig as seen here: https://twig.symfony.com/doc/1.x/installation.html, and the example may need to be modified to work with the selected installation method.

Changes:

* Macros were added to header-menu.twig.
* Twig template include was modified to remove PatternLab namespace on header-menu.twig
