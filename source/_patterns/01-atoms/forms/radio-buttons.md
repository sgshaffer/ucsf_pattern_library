### Description
The description of the atomic element will go here.

### Usage
Information regarding how is the atomic element used goes here.

### Accessibility Considerations
Fieldset and legend HTML tags should only be used to associate groups of controls when a higher level description (i.e., the legend) is necessary. Single checkboxes or basic radio buttons (such as male/female for gender) that make sense from their labels alone do not require fieldset and legend. Nested fieldsets should generally be avoided.

### Technical Considerations
Ask users to enter what is required to complete the transaction or process; if irrelevant or excessive data is requested, users are more likely to abandon the form.
