### Description
The description of the atomic element will go here.

### Usage
Information regarding how is the atomic element used goes here.

### Accessibility Considerations
Data tables very often have brief descriptive text before or after the table that indicates the content of that table. This text should be associated to its respective table using the caption element. The caption element must be the first thing after the opening table tag.

Data tables have column and/or row headers appropriately identified (using the th element).
Tables used strictly for layout purposes do NOT use the th element.
