### Accessibility Considerations
Images must have text alternatives that describe the information or function represented by them. Be sure to specify the type of image. Logo images with text are exempt from some of the accessibility requirements. For instance, there is no minimum contrast requirement. Please ensure accessibility by testing the whole page, including this element, in context.
