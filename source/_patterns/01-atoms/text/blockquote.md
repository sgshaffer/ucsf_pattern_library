### Accessibility Considerations
As a general statement, the more structured your document is, the easier it will be to understand, Blockquotes create structure by indenting quotes. Despite the fact that the blockquote element causes the text within it to be visually indented, this tag should not be used for its visual effect alone, only for a quote. Please ensure accessibility by testing the whole page, including this element, in context.
