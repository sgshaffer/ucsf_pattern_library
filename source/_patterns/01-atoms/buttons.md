# Button Example

## Description
This section contains all the approved treatments for buttons. In the future implementation of the color combinations, this section should be built out with the suggested usage of additional secondary colors as call to actions with appropriate font pairings.

## Usage
Buttons should be used to call out a desired action. Light buttons should be used against dark backgrounds, and dark buttons against light, to maintain proper contrast levels. Whenever possible, button text should be descriptive of the desired action, unique (e.g. not "Click Here") and succinct. When used in a small area, full-width versions are preferable.
