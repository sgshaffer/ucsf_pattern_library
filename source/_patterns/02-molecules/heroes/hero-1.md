### SEO Considerations
This section is left intentionally blank and is for future consideration.

### Technical Considerations
There are currently two H1s to show the different font styles (sans serif and serif). In reality, there should only be one H1.

All sliders on heroes use slick carousel and utilize the slick.js file and are included via npm. The Js file can be found in the source/js/vendor folder.  All compilation dependencies are listed in npm-shrinkwrap.json file.
