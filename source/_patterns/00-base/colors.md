# Color Examples

## Description
These are the offically supported colors for web properties of UCSF. Note they are used in "primary" and "secondary" main colors on many of the sites, although the other colors have been designed for complimentary look and feel. Future goals are to build out the suggested color combinations that ensure best practices for design and accessiblity. E.g, a light font used on a dark background.
