# Color Examples

## Description
These are the offically supported colors for web properties of UCSF. Note they are used in "primary" and "secondary" main colors on many of the sites, although the other colors have been designed for complimentary look and feel. Future goals are to build out the suggested color combinations that ensure best practices for design and accessiblity. E.g, a light font used on a dark background. 

## Usage
These are the digital versions of the UCSF Brand Identity color palette. Our interactive/digital color formulas have been created to provide opportunities for greater contrast to meet W3Câ€™s Web Content Accessibility Guideline (WCAG) AA level color contrast standards.
